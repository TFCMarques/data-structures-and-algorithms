    // Non-linear data structure
    // Nodes are organized in a hierarchy

    // A real life example of a tree could be a family tree
    // Examples of use: file explorer, databases, DNS, HTML DOM, etc.

    // The top of the tree is known as the root node
    // It has no incoming edges, only outgoing ones

    // Any nodes at the bottom of the tree are known as leaf nodes
    // They do not have any outgoing edges and only incoming ones

    // Branch nodes are all the nodes between the root and the leaves
    // These have incoming and outgoing edges

    // Other terms:
    // - Parent: any node with an outgoing edge
    // - Child: any nodes with an incoming edge
    // - Siblings: any nodes that share the same parent

    // Nodes can be both parents and children at the same time

    // Subtree is a smaller tree held within a larger tree
    // The tree size is defined by the number of nodes
    // The depth of a node is defined by the number of edges bellow the root
    // The height of a node is defined by the number of edges above the furthest leaf node
